For background, I have eczema (and possibly a form OCD which makes me compulsively scratch or pick at skin even when NOT itchy), which interacts with my sleep ecosystem in a few ways:
- I used to itch in my sleep without even realizing it, leading me to wake up to broken/inflamed skin
- I now sleep under a weighted blanket (I know some people don't recommend this but it works for me) in order to reduce the effects of the "OCD".
- The weighted blanket is quite thick and traps a lot of heat
  1. Body temperature rises in the morning before you wake up
  2. I start to sweat before I wake up, and the sweat irritates my skin
  3. I will subconsiously scratch
- I started sleeping without a shirt, but I want to sleep with a shirt.
- Duvets are the worst of both worlds. Light and hot. I like to imagine sleeping under a lead vest like you wear when you get an xray. Heavy and cold.

A heat transfer system would let me use a heavy blanket while enjoying the thermal benefits of sleeping with a thin blanket.

The heat in my condo unit rarely turns on (as the temp rarely goes lower than my setting), and my windows are large and face west, trapping sunlight and keeping the heat late into evening. Cooling in general in my place is more of a problem than heating. This is the reason why I built a bed cooler in the winter.

# Does the thing I built to help my sleep work?

it works

I woke up with the bed feeling like I had laid down for no longer than 2 minutes. I was also wearing a shirt.

It's also not uncomfortable for me. I barely feel the tubes.

Also, the radiator is standing on its end, meaning that any air conducting heat doesn't suck more cooler air through. There's no net movement of air through the radiator. I would bet it would get colder (idk by how much or if it is worth it) if it was mounted horizontally to allow air to escape on the top side and cool air to enter from the bottom. Or use fans

## Review after a weekish

Sometimes if I refuse to get out of bed and continue sleeping, my body temperature will stay increased and the system can't keep up with the amount of heat. I increased the pump speed to 4/5 and reduced the hold temperature on my thermostat to make heat transfer on the radiator more efficient. This worked very well.
